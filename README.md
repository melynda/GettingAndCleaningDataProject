#### Brief Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

#####run_analysis.R is the project file contained in this repository that accomplishes the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set achieved from the steps above, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#####CodeBook.md is the markdown file contained in this repository that contains an explanation of all data, variables and transformations.

#####tidy_data_avg_mean_stddev.txt is the independent tidy data set produced by the run_analysis.R script.  This data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
